		"header": "FAQ",
		"why": {
			"question": "Why should I accept Bitcoin?",
			"answer": "At a high level, the more people that use and accept Bitcoin, the better off the world will be. Merchants save on transaction fees, consumers gain financial freedom and privacy, and savers get to hold an asset that gains purchasing power over time. Besides that, we'll promote your business to a large and enthusiastic community of Bitcoiners both locally and globally who are always looking for new places to spend their coin and prefer to frequent businesses that accept it directly. We're active on social media, we host regular in-person events and meetups, and we'll take care of listing your business on a number of sites and directories to bring you new customers and positive reviews."
    },
		"cost": {
			"question": "What does it cost?",
			"answer": "There are no setup, maintenance or processing fees. We plan to offer a premium plan in the future for those wanting extra support or promotional services but for now everything is free. Withdrawals may incur a network routing fee or miner fee which doesn't go to us and can vary depending on network conditions. We charge a 0.1% conversion fee if you send out over a different network than the one you received on (i.e. on-chain vs. lightning -- please ask if you're not sure what that means)."
		},
		"compatibility": {
			"question": "Do I need any special device or software?",
			"answer": "No. Coinos is web based so as long as you have an internet connection, it works anywhere. Retail merchants might use it on a tablet or you might direct customers to visit your payment page from their phone. You may wish to use a small printer to get payment notifications in which case staff won't need to figure out how to use our app at all, they can just treat the paper receipts from the printer like cash. We're currently providing printers (that cost ~$50) for free to merchants in Vancouver as a kind of sign-on bonus so please ask if this is of interest."
		},
		"safety": {
			"question": "When do my funds settle?",
			"answer": "Lightning payments are settled instantly. You can withdraw your entire balance to another wallet within seconds of receiving a payment. On-chain Bitcoin payments usually settle within 5 to 10 minutes if the sender sets an appropriate transaction fee."
		},
		"offramp": {
			"question": "Can I cash out to my local currency?",
			"answer": "If you're a Canadian retail merchant, you can ask us to automatically convert any Bitcoin you receive up to $10,000 per month. We'll send an Interac e-Transfer whenever your balance exceeds $500. For larger amounts or international users, we'll refer you to a third party exchange or brokerage."
		},
    "pos": {
      "question": "Can Coinos integrate with my existing PoS?",
      "answer": "We recommend entering any Bitcoin sales into your existing PoS as normal cash transactions. You can give the customer a receipt just as if they'd paid physical cash. If you require some custom integration, we have an API and are happy to work with your PoS vendor to integrate it."
    },
    "training": {
      "question": "What does my staff need to know?",
      "answer": "When customers ask to pay with Bitcoin, staff should enter it as a regular cash sale. If you use a printer to get payment notifications, staff can put the receipts in the till and total them up at cash out. If using a tablet, use the 'Add to Homescreen' feature in your browser menu to get a Coinos icon that staff can click to launch the app and create payment requests. After entering the sale amount, they can turn the tablet over to the customer to add a tip and scan the QR code that will display, then look for a green checkmark to indicate the payment was received."
    },
    "refunds": {
      "question": "What about refunds?",
      "answer": "If a customer sends a wrong amount or otherwise needs a refund, you can ask them to provide a lightning invoice or address and send them a payment from the app. You could also refund them with cash."
    },
    "accounting": {
      "question": "How will this impact my accounting?",
      "answer": "Coinos displays all payments in terms of your local currency and lets you filter by date so you can easily report your income. If you sell some of the Bitcoin you receive later on, you may be required to pay capital gains tax if it went up in value. We provide a csv download of your account history that can be opened as a spreadsheet or sent to your accountant that makes this determination easy. This won't be an issue if we're settling your account in CAD. In that case we'll be purchasing the bitcoin from your customers at the time of sale for the exact dollar value of the sale and giving you a deferred cash settlement, so you'll never be exposed to exchange rate fluctuations."
    },
    "bitcoin": {
      "question": "What can I do with the Bitcoin I receive?",
      "answer": "Spend it at other merchants you find at btcmap.org or lightningnetworkstores.com, buy gift cards at coincards.ca, pay your expenses by getting your staff, suppliers, and landlord to accept it. You could even register Coinos accounts on their behalf and give it out for tips and bonuses. Bitcoin has averaged a 73% annual return over the past decade so saving it may not be the worst idea either."
    },
    "security": {
      "question": "Is Coinos secure?",
      "answer": "We take security very seriously and do our best to ensure that funds in our custody are safe. We've been at this for several years now. We only keep a modest amount of funds available on our server for immediate withdrawals at any given time, the rest is stored securely offline. Our source code is open source and we've had it audited by professional security teams.  We continually monitor and maintain our servers. That said, it's always a best practice to take custody of your own Bitcoin by withdrawing it to a wallet that only you have access to, especially once your balance reaches a point where you'd be sorry to lose it. Please don't hesitate to reach out for other wallet recommendations and advice on this."
